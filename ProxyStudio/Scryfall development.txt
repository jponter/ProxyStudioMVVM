ProxyStudio CardSearch Feature - Development Summary
🎯 Project Context
Working on adding Scryfall card search functionality to ProxyStudio, a .NET 9 Avalonia MVVM application for creating proxy card PDFs. The goal is to let users search for Magic: The Gathering cards and add them to their collection alongside existing MPC Fill XML imports.
✅ Successfully Implemented (CardSearch Branch)
Architecture & File Structure

✅ Services/ICardSearchService.cs - Generic interface for card search services
✅ Services/ScryfallSearchService.cs - Scryfall-specific implementation (test data)
✅ ViewModels/CardSearchViewModel.cs - Full MVVM implementation with RelayCommands
✅ Views/CardSearchView.axaml - Complete UI with 3-column layout matching existing design
✅ Services/CardSearch/CardSearchResult.cs - DTO for search results
✅ Services/CardSearch/SearchFilters.cs - Filter options (empty, ready for expansion)
✅ Models/SearchProgress.cs - Progress reporting class

Working Functionality

✅ Search Interface - Text input, filters UI, search button
✅ Test Search Results - Returns 3 mock cards with query parameter
✅ Results Display - Cards show in 3-column grid layout
✅ Selection System - Individual checkboxes, Select All, Clear Selection
✅ Selection Counters - Real-time count updates, enable/disable buttons
✅ Add to Collection - Selected cards convert to full Card objects and appear in main collection
✅ Image Generation - Creates test images (colored backgrounds) for each card
✅ Error Handling - Proper logging and error dialogs integrated
✅ UI Integration - Matches existing design system, proper binding

Technical Details

✅ MVVM Pattern - ObservableProperties, RelayCommands, proper separation
✅ Dependency Injection - Services properly registered and injected
✅ Progress Reporting - Uses IProgress<SearchProgress> pattern like MPC Fill
✅ Card Creation - Uses existing Card constructor with ConfigManager
✅ Collection Integration - Cards appear alongside MPC Fill imports
✅ Logging - Debug/Info/Error logging throughout workflow
✅ Test Data - Mock search returns predictable results for testing

Current ConvertToCardAsync Implementation
csharp// Creates Card objects with test images
// Different colored backgrounds per card (hash-based)
// 1500x2100 pixel resolution (600 DPI base)
// Proper error handling with placeholder cards
🔧 Integration Status
DI Registration (App.axaml.cs)
csharpservices.AddHttpClient<ScryfallSearchService>();
services.AddSingleton<ICardSearchService, ScryfallSearchService>();
MainViewModel Integration
csharp// CardSearchViewModel properly created with all dependencies
// EditMeCommand passed to new cards
// Shared CardCollection reference working
UI Integration

✅ New tab added to MainView.axaml TabControl
✅ Three-column layout (380px | * | 320px) matching Cards tab
✅ All design system classes used (card, sidebar, modern, etc.)
✅ Phosphor icons and semantic colors working
✅ Progress states and empty states implemented

🎯 Next Session Goal: Real Scryfall Search
Current State

Test search working: Returns mock "Lightning Bolt", "Black Lotus", "Ancestral Recall"
Ready for real API: All infrastructure in place

Next Implementation
Replace test data in ScryfallSearchService.SearchAsync() with:

Real Scryfall API calls - https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?q={query}
JSON response parsing - Map to CardSearchResult DTOs
Rate limiting - 50-100ms between requests
Filter support - set, color, type, rarity parameters
Error handling - Network failures, invalid queries, no results

API Models Already Created
csharppublic class ScryfallCardResponse
{
    [JsonPropertyName("id")] public string Id { get; set; }
    [JsonPropertyName("name")] public string Name { get; set; }
    [JsonPropertyName("type_line")] public string TypeLine { get; set; }
    // ... other properties
}
Key Scryfall Endpoints

Search: https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?q=lightning
Named: https://api.scryfall.com/cards/named?fuzzy=lightning%20bolt
Random: https://api.scryfall.com/cards/random

Testing Status

✅ End-to-end workflow confirmed working
✅ Cards successfully added to collection
✅ Different colored test images distinguishable
✅ UI state management working perfectly
✅ Error handling and logging verified

📋 Architecture Notes

Following existing MpcFillService patterns
Two-phase approach: lightweight search results → full Card objects
Proper async/await with progress reporting
Error-resilient with graceful fallbacks
Ready for caching implementation later

Status: CardSearch feature architecturally complete, test implementation fully working, ready for real Scryfall API integration.
